# NPM Package Template

Use this template to quickly set up and release npm packages with ease. This template is configured to automate the release process using semantic-release and provides commitizen support for standardized commit messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository to create a new repository based on this template.

2. Clone the newly created repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-package.git
   ```

3. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-package
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

   ```

### Initializing Husky

Husky is a tool that helps you set up Git hooks easily. These hooks can run checks or tasks before you commit or push changes. This template uses Husky to enforce commit message conventions.

To initialize Husky, run the following command:

```bash
npx husky-init && yarn
```

### Initializing Commitizen

Commitizen is a tool that helps you write consistent and conventional commit messages. It prompts you to fill in the required commit message fields, ensuring your commits are well-structured.

To initialize Commitizen with this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --yarn --dev --exact --force
```
